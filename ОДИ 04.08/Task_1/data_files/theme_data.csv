1;gateway;The syntax {D1,D2,...,Dn} denotes a tuple whose arguments are D1, D2, ... Dn. In 1989 the building was heavily damaged by fire, but it has since been restored. Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language. Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. Where are my pants?;2025-05-01 12:57:03;2
2;rank;Ports are used to communicate with the external world. They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the first character being lowercase. Make me a sandwich. They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the first character being lowercase.

3;respective;Haskell is a standardized, general-purpose purely functional programming language, with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. The syntax {D1,D2,...,Dn} denotes a tuple whose arguments are D1, D2, ... Dn. Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom. Ports are used to communicate with the external world. Haskell features a type system with type inference and lazy evaluation.;2025-01-11 11:45:07;15
4;mortgage;The sequential subset of Erlang supports eager evaluation, single assignment, and dynamic typing. Ports are created with the built-in function open_port. Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language. Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values. Do you have any idea why this is not working?;2025-08-20 06:54:29;17
5;trucks;Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language. Initially composing light-hearted and irreverent works, he also wrote serious, sombre and religious pieces beginning in the 1930s. Ports are created with the built-in function open_port. The Galactic Empire is nearing completion of the Death Star, a space station with the power to destroy entire planets. Ports are used to communicate with the external world.;2025-12-22 14:01:47;14
6;mile;He looked inquisitively at his keyboard and wrote another sentence. The arguments can be primitive data types or compound data types. Initially composing light-hearted and irreverent works, he also wrote serious, sombre and religious pieces beginning in the 1930s. They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the first character being lowercase. Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time.;2025-01-11 10:32:01;17

9;federal;"Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types. Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time. Messages can be sent to and received from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called ""port protocol."" Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types. It is also a garbage-collected runtime system.";2025-05-18 15:24:22;19
